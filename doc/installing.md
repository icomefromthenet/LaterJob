## Install via Composer

```php
 "require" : {
        "icomefromthenet/laterjob" :"dev-master"
 }
```

## Using the Git Repo

Make sure to run composer to download the dependecies, if you want to run the tests you will need to use the ``--dev`` option.

You can use the [migration library](https://github.com/icomefromthenet/Migrations) to setup your database schema.
